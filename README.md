# Didi â€” AI, Automation & DevOps Engineer

Hi! Iâ€™m Didi, a developer passionate about building real-world solutions at the intersection of **automation, AI, and DevOps/MLOps**.

I'm currently working via **Upwork**, helping clients automate and scale their workflows with:

- **n8n**, **Zapier**, **Make.com**, and **Python**  
- **Custom API integrations**, database syncs, webhook logic, and AI-enhanced automations

At the same time, I'm **learning in public** â€” building a full **Kubernetes home lab**, mastering **GitOps**, **CI/CD**, and **self-hosted DevOps tooling** from the ground up.

Alongside my technical work, I bring a deep commitment to inner work and human development.

I'm a dedicated **Vipassana** meditator and currently training in **Collective Trauma Healing** Facilitation â€” aiming to bridge tech engineering with high emotional intelligence and trauma-informed awareness.
