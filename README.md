# Didi — AI, Automation & DevOps Engineer

Hi! I'm Didi, a developer passionate about building real-world solutions at the intersection of **automation, AI, and DevOps**.

I help businesses automate and scale their workflows with:

- **n8n**, **Zapier**, **Make.com**, and **Python**  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) bots** for eCommerce businesses
- **Custom API integrations**, database syncs, webhook logic, and AI-enhanced automations

At the same time, I'm **building in public** — deploying production AWS infrastructure, running Kubernetes home labs, and mastering **GitOps**, **CI/CD**, and **self-hosted DevOps tooling** through hands-on implementation.

## 🧑‍💻 Early Roots in Linux & Networking

My journey with Linux began at age 12, compiling kernels on **FreeBSD**, experimenting with **Red Hat**, and reverse engineering **TCP/IP stacks** for fun. I wrote my first programs in **C** and loved diving deep into how systems and networks actually worked under the hood.

That early curiosity for operating systems and protocols never left me — it's what drives me today to master the modern DevOps stack with the same hands-on, experimental mindset.
