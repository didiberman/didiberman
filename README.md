# Hey, I'm Didi

I've been taking computers apart (and occasionally putting them back together) since I was 12, when I was compiling FreeBSD kernels and reverse-engineering TCP/IP stacks for fun. That obsession with understanding *how things actually work* never went away - it just evolved into building cloud infrastructure, automation pipelines, and AI systems.

These days I work at the intersection of **DevOps, Cloud, and AI**. I help businesses automate their workflows, and I build my own production systems where uptime and cost actually matter.

## What I'm Exploring

**[Hetzner-Kubelab-Pipeline](https://github.com/didiberman/terraform-k8s-argocd-cicd-pipeline)** - Deploy 1 master node and 4 worker nodes on Hetzner, with a basic application + CI/CD pipeline with ArgoCD + Prometheus + Grafana


**[Terraform-K8s-Kusama-Validator-Project](https://github.com/didiberman/terraform-kusama-k8s-validator-project)** - A cluster of Kusama validators that can expand / contract 

**[Video Generating SaaS](https://github.com/didiberman/saas-video-kie)** - A serverless AI video generator SaaS with Frontend. Send a text or voice message, get a video back. Built with Google Cloud Run Functions.

**[Content Machine](https://github.com/didiberman/content-machine)** - A serverless AI video generator. Send a text or voice message, get a video back. Built with AWS Lambda and a multi-agent AI pipeline.

**[ChatOps Static Site Platform](https://github.com/didiberman/terraform-aws-chatops-site)** - Deploy websites by texting a Telegram bot. Built in one day using patterns I'd refined over months. Costs essentially nothing to run.

**[Serverless Transcription Bot](https://github.com/didiberman/tf-telegram-serverless-transcription-aws)** - Voice notes to text via AWS Transcribe. 100% serverless, zero idle costs.

I also maintain production RAG bots and n8n workflows for a German eCommerce agency - real systems, real users, real consequences when things break.

## The Boring-But-Important Stuff

- **Certifications:** AWS Cloud Practitioner ✓, AWS Solutions Architect Associate ✓, CKA (Feb 2026), AWS GenAI Developer Professional (March 2026)
- **Stack:** Terraform, Kubernetes, AWS (Lambda, S3, CloudFront, Bedrock), Python, n8n, Docker, GitHub Actions
- **Philosophy:** Infrastructure as Code, GitOps, cost optimization, and building systems that serve humans (not the other way around)

## Other Projects

If you want to dig deeper, here are some older experiments:

- [Instagram Lead Hunter AI](https://github.com/didiberman/insta-lead-hunter-ai) - AI-enhanced lead qualification
- [YouTube → Medium Agent](https://github.com/didiberman/youtube-medium-article-agent) - Automated video-to-article pipeline
- [YouTube Comment Classifier](https://github.com/didiberman/youtube-comment-classifier-mlops) - MLOps pipeline with FastAPI + K3s
- [TCP Hijacker Classic](https://github.com/didiberman/tcp-hijacker-classic) - Educational networking/security tool (a callback to my early days)

**Currently:** Preparing for CKA, running KubeLab, and exploring for DevOps/Cloud Engineering opportunities in Germany.
