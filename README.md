# Didi — AI, Automation & Cloud Solutions Engineer

Hi! I'm Didi, a technologist building real-world solutions at the intersection of **Automation, AI, and DevOps**.

I help businesses scale their workflows by engineering:
- **Intelligent RAG Agents** for eCommerce (customer support & sales)
- **Complex Automation Pipelines** using n8n, Python, and AWS
- **Resilient Cloud Infrastructure** with Terraform and GitOps practices

At the same time, I am **building in public**—deploying production AWS infrastructure, running Kubernetes home labs, and mastering the modern DevOps stack through hands-on implementation.

## 🧑‍💻 My roots
My journey began at age 12, compiling kernels on **FreeBSD**, experimenting with **Red Hat**, and reverse engineering **TCP/IP stacks**. I wrote my first programs in **C** and developed a deep fascination for how systems and networks function under the hood.

That early foundational knowledge of operating systems and protocols is what drives me today. I approach modern DevOps not just as "tooling," but with a systems-engineering mindset.

## 💼 Real-World Production Systems
Beyond learning, I build and maintain live infrastructure where uptime and cost matter.

- **Multi-Site AWS Hosting:** Deployed Terraform-managed S3 + CloudFront infrastructure for multiple live domains with global CDN distribution.
- **Cost Engineering:** Migrated a Telegram analytics bot from paid hosting to AWS Lambda (Free Tier), achieving **80% cost reduction**.
- **Security-First CI/CD:** Implemented OIDC authentication for GitHub Actions → AWS to eliminate hardcoded credentials.
- **eCommerce Automation:** Currently maintaining production RAG bots and n8n workflows for a German eCommerce agency, handling customer support and inventory logic.
